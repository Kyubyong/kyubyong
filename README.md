I'm writing to inform that I'm not allowed to introduce myself as "I work for Kakao Brain." any more. I left Kakao Brain, where I've put my heart for the last four years, and began a new journey on my own. Luckily, I'm not alone on that road not taken. I'm with six great co-founding members--all of them were my team mates at Kakao Brain. We named our startup **TUNiB**, inspired by the popular animation character (https://octonauts.fandom.com/wiki/Tunip_the_Vegimal). We are still at the very early stage, preparing for IR. Please support us as well as Kakao Brain. You can reach us/me at my email: either ryan.ai@tunib.ai or kbpark.linguist@gmail.com.

Best,<br>
Kyubyong
