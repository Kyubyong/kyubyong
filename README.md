Hi all,

I'm writing to inform that I'm not allowed to introduce myself as "I work for Kakao Brain." any more. I'm leaving Kakao Brain, where I've put my heart for the last four years, and beginning a journey on my own. Luckily, I'm not alone on that journey. I'm with six great co-founding members--all of them were my team mates at Kakao Brain. We named our startup TUNiB, inspired by the popular animation character (https://octonauts.fandom.com/wiki/Tunip_the_Vegimal). We are still at the very early stage, preparing for IR. Please support us as well as Kakao Brain. You can reach us/me at my email: kbpark.linguist@gmail.com until we have the tunib.ai email address ready.

Best,
Kyubyong
